Routing:

Next 13 changes how routing is implemented, using the app/ directory:
Add [pagemane]/page.jsx to app/ - this automatically creates the /[pagename] route.
Link to route with Link componenet: <Link href='/[pagename]'>Page Name</Link>
Nest child page jsx files in their own directory within parent directory

Layouts:
Add a layout for a route by adding a layout.jsx file adjacent to the page.jsx file.
Export the layout function as a react component, with {children} parameters
Use {children} in layout jsx to display contents of page function
All children will inherit the closest layout

Meta:
Root <head> meta is configured in root layout
Override for a specific page by exporting a metadata object in page's component file.
This will not apply to children, but can be used in layout file instead to accomplish this

Fonts:
Use next/font api for font optimization and improved privacy and performance

Server components vs Client components:
Components are rendered server side by default
Begin file with 'use client'; to convert it to a client component

Pros / Cons of server components:
Pros:
- Load faster - Don't have to wait for the JavaScript to load
- Smaller client bundle size
- SEO friendly
- Access to resources the client can't access
- Hide sensitive data from the client
- More secure against XSS attacks
- Improved developer experience
- Just like with anything else, there are also disadvantages:

Cons:
- Not as interactive
- No component state. We can not use the useState hook.
- No component lifecycle methods. We can not use the useEffect hook.

Loading State:
Add loading.jsx to app/ and export a function of any name
This will display while a new server component page is being loaded

Dynamic Routes:
Represent a page for dynamic routes by placing it in a [name] folder (or whatever you want to call it)
A route at ex: about/cool-thing will load app/about/[name]
Access the param passed in the folder name by retrieving `params` in component parameters

Suspense Boundaries (React, not Next specific):
Import Suspense react component and wrap an asynchronously loading component
This will have it load separately from everything else
Pass it a fallback argument to show something while loading

Public API with API Routes:
Any file inside the folder pages/api is mapped to /api/* and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a page.
